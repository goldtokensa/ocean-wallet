# DGLD Ocean wallet

This repository hosts releases of the Ocean platform Wallet configured for the DGLD blockchain. 

These executables are compiled directly from the master branch of the main CommerceBlock Ocean Wallet [repository](https://github.com/commerceblock/cb-client-wallet) using the deterministic build processes in the `contrib` directory.
